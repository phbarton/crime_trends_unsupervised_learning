    "# Background\n",
    "Crime analytics involves the use of data analysis techniques to understand crime patterns and trends. By clustering similar crime incidents, we can identify hotspots and common factors contributing to criminal activities. This information can be used to develop targeted action plans for different districts, enhancing public safety and resource allocation. This project uses real crime data reported in Raleigh, NC, to demonstrate the application of clustering algorithms and recommender systems in crime analytics."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Gather crime data from reliable sources, including incident reports, locations, times, and types of crimes.\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.\n",
    "4. Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar crime incidents based on features such as location, time, and type of crime.\n",
    "5. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF): Use NMF to reduce dimensionality and extract latent features from the clustered data.\n",
    "6. Recommender System: Develop a recommender system to suggest district-level action plans based on the identified clusters.\n",
    "7. Prediction and Evaluation: Test the recommender system's effectiveness in predicting crime trends and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics."
